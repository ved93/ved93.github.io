title: Problem-Solving in Data Science
---


Few years back, when I started my journey in data-science, I was fascinated by Kaggle. I used to devote my time there. I was overwhelmed by the knowledge and problems. I wanted to be competitive and kaggle shows their leaderboard. You win and make a name. 
I used to have casual discussions with my manager on variety of topics. One day I asked my manager which things are most important in data science and what's his opinion about Kaggle.  

He said  "***Problem Solving** is one of the most important skill in data scientist. As far as kaggle is concerned I dont think Kaggle helps you to become a good problem solver.If you know Xs and Y then almost anyone can solve the problem. Most important part is defining your Xs and Y*"  

After sometime I gave a thought about it and he was right. In my experience, most of the problems I solved was the result of the way problem defined. Most often, Its almost never a question to build a most accurate model, rather it is solving the problem. Kaggle comes in handy to know different approaches to solve the problems. But its not a critical to your success in data-science career.
