I still remember the day when an interviewer was intracting with candidates in the college before the interview process.
He asked, "Why do you want to do data science"?
One candidate replied, "Because it doesn't require programming".

Interviewer paused for a moment, and then replied, "If you think you dont need to code, then you shouldnot apply".

In data science, people come from multiple deciplines. Some are from computer science, some are from statistics, some are from mathematics, some are from economics, some are from business, and some are from other fields.
data scientist got the reputation of writing bad codes. I myself have commited this crime. I always wanted to write good code, but I did not know what is a good code. I used to discussed with my friend how can organize my data-science workflow effectively. I started exploring in the github repos. Then I worked on production system and there was never looking back. I started investing more in learning software side of things. 

Now I have come to believe, "to be a efficient data scientist you need to have good software engineering skills" 
Writing quality code and having software engineering mindset enables you to work efficiently. People who just do .fit and .predict are not going to be successful in the long run. If you know how to build machine learning powered systems, you will be in a great position.

I have seen places where data science team depends on engineering team to productionize their models. This is not a good practice. Data science team should be able to productionize their models. This has lot of problems

1. Data science team is not able to iterate fast. You will always be dependent on engineering team to productionize your models. This will slow down your iteration speed. I have experienced this at multiple places. I had worked on a project where we had the complete authority on productionazing our models. We were able to iterate fast and productionize our models. We were able to do A/B testing and see the results. Another project I had worked it required dependency on production team. Countless hours were spent on priortizing and communication with production team. We were not able to iterate fast. 

2. As data scientist, you will never understand the production system. You will never know how your model is being used. If they are using the wrong way then your project will not yield the desired results. Many a times, it will happen that due to bug in production system, your model is not working as expected.  
3. Debugging: Its great skill to have. 

To be honest, its not hard to learn software engineering skills. A data scientist is a software engineer first. Try to observe patterns in the software systems.
