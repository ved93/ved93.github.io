ðŸ‘‹, I am Ved

This is my thought dumps where I write unfiltered. I write about things I am learning, things I am building and things I am thinking about. By no means, I am an expert in any of these things. I am just a curious person who likes to learn and share.
Above is the bullshit that I wanted to write about me, but hell yeah!! I think my thoughts can be useful to some.  
The opinions expressed here represent my own and not those of my employer. Mostly I will write about non-techincal aspects of data science.
